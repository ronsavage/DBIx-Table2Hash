[V 1.14]
Date=2005-10-27T19:40:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
as per the new standard on such matters
- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}'
which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file
which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

[V 1.12]
Date=2003-03-23T11:29:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add a new constructor/method parameter: skip_columns. This is an
array ref of columns names to ignore when calling select_tree()
- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros because the
PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro
which means it does not index the module and this in turn means
the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list etc.

[V 1.11]
Date=2003-01-26T12:28:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add method select_tree() which reads a table into a nested hash ie a tree.
This tree is suitable for inputting into CGI::Explorer V 2.00
(forthcoming) as long as the tree has a single root.
Note: select_tree() is an alternative to the fine module DBIx::Tree
- Add a new demo test-table2tree.pl to demonstrate select_tree().
Note: The database table for this demo is created by test-hash2table.pl
the demo which ships with DBIx::Hash2Table
- Fix bug so select_hashref() - and now select_tree() - can take an SQL
expression for the value of the key_column parameter.
Previously only select() would work when you tried this.
- Update docs

[V 1.10]
Date=2003-01-17T11:01:55
Comments= <<EOT
- Add method select_hashref() for when you want a hashref associated with
each key where the original method select() just associates a single
value with each key. In this case the constructor parameter
value_column is ignored and can be omitted
- Change the sanity checks and error messages now that value_column can
be an optional parameter
- Add an directory examples/ with a complete program which loads a table
from a text file into the test database and calls select_hashref()
and select() to display the data. This demo also shows the way to use
exception handling and suggests one way to corrupt the source code
in order to trigger an exception with die rather than with throw
- Update the docs
- Change use CGI; to use Carp;. So much for my scrupulous testing regime
