Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Table2Hash.

1.18  2021-02-07T16:22:00
	- Adopt new repo structure. See
		http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
	- Update POD to change RT to github.
	- Reformat Makefile.PL.
	- Add t/00*.

1.17  2010-02-21T12:55:05
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.

1.16  2010-02-10T14:01:56
	- MANIFEST.SKIP updated to exclude MYMETA.yml. Add MYMETA.yml.

1.15  2009-11-13T13:20:00
	- Run dos2unix
	- Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES

1.14  2005-10-27T19:40:00
	- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
		as per the new standard on such matters
	- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
		META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
		which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file,
		which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
		ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

1.13  2004-07-20T20:43:00
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Delete ./test.pl
	- Delete 'use Data::Dumper;' from Table2Hash.pm, left over from testing
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.12  2003-03-23T11:29:00
	- Add a new constructor/method parameter: skip_columns. This is an
		array ref of columns names to ignore when calling select_tree()
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.

1.11  2003-01-26T12:28:00
	- Add method select_tree(), which reads a table into a nested hash, ie a tree.
		This tree is suitable for inputting into CGI::Explorer V 2.00
		(forthcoming), as long as the tree has a single root.
		Note: select_tree() is an alternative to the fine module DBIx::Tree
	- Add a new demo, test-table2tree.pl, to demonstrate select_tree().
		Note: The database table for this demo is created by test-hash2table.pl,
		the demo which ships with DBIx::Hash2Table
	- Fix bug so select_hashref() - and now select_tree() - can take an SQL
		expression for the value of the key_column parameter.
		Previously, only select() would work when you tried this.
	- Update docs

1.10  2003-01-17T11:01:55
	- Add method select_hashref() for when you want a hashref associated with
		each key, where the original method select() just associates a single
		value with each key. In this case, the constructor parameter
		value_column is ignored, and can be omitted
	- Change the sanity checks and error messages, now that value_column can
		be an optional parameter
	- Add an directory ,examples/, with a complete program which loads a table
		from a text file into the test database, and calls select_hashref()
		and select() to display the data. This demo also shows the way to use
		exception handling, and suggests one way to corrupt the source code
		in order to trigger an exception with die rather than with throw
	- Update the docs
	- Change use CGI; to use Carp;. So much for my scrupulous testing regime

1.00  2003-01-04T12:37:29
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-A -X -f -n DBIx::Table2Hash -v 1.00
